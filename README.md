*Lab written by Pat Hanrahan, updated by Julie Zelenski*

## Goals

During this lab you will:

- Understand how executing programs are laid out in memory, 
  including the organization of stack frames.
- Explore the stack and heap in preparation for assignment 4.
- Experiment with the linker `ld`, with the goal of understanding what is in
  an object (ELF) file by using `nm`, and how object files are combined to produce an executable.
- Read and understand the source to the bootloader. It is important to be able
  to read code produced in the wild.

## Prelab preparation
To prepare for lab, do the following: 

- Pull the latest version of the `cs107e.github.io` courseware repository.
- Clone the lab repository `https://github.com/cs107e/lab4`. 
- Read this [recap of stack frames and the APCS full frame](stack/). 
  Review the code for example program we will study in lab in [code/simple/simple.c](code/simple/simple.c). This program makes use of the stack for function calls, recursion, and local variables. Here is a [diagram of the program's address space](images/stack_abs.html) when stopped in the first call to `abs`. Make a printout of this diagram so you can mark it up with your notes as you study it. A solid understanding of the memory layout of your program is an essential starting point for your next assignment. 

## Lab exercises
<a name="stack"></a>
### 1. Stack

Refer to prelab for background reading on the stack and the APCS full frame. Change to the directory `lab4/code/simple`.  This program makes use of the stack for function calls, recursion, and local variables. We will use this program to study management of stack frames. Have your printed copy of the program's [memory diagram](images/stack_abs.html) handy for making notes.

Run `simple.elf` under the gdb simulator. Disassemble the `abs` function and read through its assembly instructions.

```console?prompt=(gdb)
(gdb) disass abs
Dump of assembler code for function abs:
   0x00008010 <+0>: mov r12, sp
   0x00008014 <+4>: push  {r11, r12, lr, pc}
   0x00008018 <+8>: sub r11, r12, #4, 0
   0x0000801c <+12>:  cmp r0, #0, 0
   0x00008020 <+16>:  rsblt r0, r0, #0, 0
   0x00008024 <+20>:  sub sp, r11, #12, 0
   0x00008028 <+24>:  ldm sp, {r11, sp, lr}
   0x0000802c <+28>:  bx  lr
End of assembler dump.
```

The first three instructions (`<+0>, <+4>, <+8>`) comprise the function _prolog_ which sets up the
stack frame. The last three instructions (`<+20>, <+24>, <+28>`) are the function _epilog_ which tears down the stack frame and restores caller-owned registers. The basic structure of the prolog and epilog is common to all functions, with some variation due to differences in local variables or use of caller-owner registers. 

Put your heads together with your tablemates and carefully trace through instructions in the prolog and epilog. Mark up your copy of the memory diagram and relate to the action of the instructions.  Below are some issues to note and questions to discuss as you work through it.

__Function prolog__:
- Register `r11` is used as the frame pointer `fp`. The disassembly in gdb refers to `r11`, while an objdump listing calls it `fp`. The two are completely synonymous, so don't let that trip you up.
- Which four registers are pushed to the stack to set up the
APCS frame?  
- Three of the four registers in the APCS frame are caller-owned registers whose values are preserved in the prolog and later restored in the epilog. Which three are they? Which register is the fourth? Why is that register handled differently?  What is that register even pushed at all as part of the APCS frame?
- What instruction in the prolog anchors `fp` to point to the current frame?
- To what location in the stack does the `fp` point?
- The first instruction of the prolog copies `sp` to `r12` and then uses `r12` in the push that follows. This dance may seems roundabout, but is unavoidable. Do you have an idea why? (Hint: a direct reference to `sp` in a push/pop instruction that itself is changing `sp` sounds like trouble...)

__Function body__:
- Which instructions correspond to the body of the `abs` function? 
- Work out how these instructions do the job of the `abs` function. Where does it read the value of `v` from?  Where does it write the return value?
- To what location in the stack does the `sp` point when executing the body?

__Function epilog__:
- The first instruction of the epilog changes the `sp`. To what location does it pointer after executing that instruction?
- The `ldm` instruction ("load multiple") reads a sequence of words starting at a base address in memory and stores the words into the named registers. `pop` is a specific variant of `ldm` that additionally adjusts the base address as a side effect (i.e. changing the stack pointer effectively "removes" words from the stack) . The `ldm` instruction used in the epilog of `abs` copies three words in memory starting at the stack pointer into the registers `r11`, `sp`, and `lr`.  This restores those three registers to the value they had at time of function entry.  
- The value of fourth register that was pushed is not restored into the register `pc`, nor does the value seem to be popped from the stack.  Why is it important to __not__ restore the value of the `pc` to the value it had on entry?  How the values are removed from the stack is quite subtle. The prolog does not use `pop`, so no auto adjustment is being done to `sp`. When `ldm` restores `sp` to the saved value it had at time of function entry, this has effectively popped all the saved registers that were pushed.  Tricky!
- The final instruction of `abs` is branch exchange that returns control
to the caller. Who is the caller of `abs`? What is the address of the 
instruction in the caller that will be executed when `abs` returns?  Which registers/memory values are updated by the `bx` instruction? 

Relate your understanding of the stack to the [memory diagram](images/stack_abs.html). The diagram shows the entire address space of the `simple`
program, including the text, data, and stack segments.  Use the diagram to confirm your understanding of how the stack operates and what is stored where in the address space. It may also help to run gdb on the program, step to the same point in execution and using the commands `backtrace` and `info frame` to examine stack frames and `disassemble` to view the assembly instructions and relate those observations to the diagram.

The diagram contains a lot of details, but if you take the time to closely inspect it, you will gain a more complete understanding of the relationship between the contents of memory, registers, and the executing program.   Go over it with your tablemates and ask questions of each other until everyone has a clear picture of how memory is laid out and how stack frames are managed.  Answer the first check-in question[^1] now.

Once you understand the prolog/epilog of `abs`, use gdb to
examine the disassembly for `diff` and `main`. 
Identify what part of the prolog and
epilog are common to all three functions and where they differ. What is the reason for those differences?

Lastly, disassemble `make_array` to see how the stack is used
to store local variables.  Sketch a picture of its stack frame as you follow along with the function instructions.

- After the instructions for the standard prolog, what additional instruction makes space for the array local variable?
- How are the contents for the array initialized (or not)? 
- In the body of the function, the array elements stored on the stack are accessed `fp`-relative.  What is the relative offset from the `fp` to the base of the array? How can you determine that from reading the assembly instructions?
- The prolog has an additional instruction to allocate space for the array, but the epilog does not seem to have a corresponding instruction to  deallocate the space. How then is the stack pointer adjusted to remove any local variables when the function has finished?

Compare your sketch to this [stack diagram for make_array](images/stack_makearray.html). Does your understanding line up?

### 2. Heap

Change to the directory `lab4/code/heapclient` to begin your foray in heap allocation.
So far we have stored our data either as local variables on the stack or global variables in the data segment. The functions `malloc` and `free`  offer another option, this one with more precise control of the size and lifetime and greater versatility at runtime.

Study the program `heapclient.c`. The `tokenize` function is used to 
dissect a string into a sequence of space-separated tokens. The function calls on the not-yet-implemented function `char *strndup(const char *src, size_t n)` to make a copy of each token. The intended behavior of `strndup` is to return a new string containing the first `n` characters of the `src` string.

Talk over with your partner why it would not be correct for `strndup` to declare a local array variable in its stack frame to store the new string.  When a function exits, its stack frame is deallocated and the memory is recycled for use by the next function call.  What would be the consequence if `strndup` mistakenly returns a pointer to memory contained within its to-be-deallocated stack frame?

Instead `strndup` must allocate space from the heap, so that the data can persist after the function exits. Edit `strndup` to use a call to `malloc` to request the necessary number of bytes. How many total bytes of space are needed to store a string with `n` characters?  

Now that you have the necessary memory set aside, what function from the `strings` module can you call to copy the first `n` characters from the `src` string to the new memory?

What is the final step you must take to complete the new string? (Hint: how is the end of a string marked?)

Once you have completed your implementation of `strndup` to make a proper heap copy of the string, build and run the program to verify your code is correct.

Unlike stack and global memory, which is automatically deallocated on your behalf, you must explicitly free dynamic memory when you are done with it. For the finishing touch, edit `main` to add the necessary calls to `free` to properly deallocate all of the heap memory it used. You're ready for this check-in question[^2]

### 3. Linking and memmap

In this exercise, you will repeat some of the live coding demonstrations shown in the lecture on linking and loading.

Let's first review some terminology. An _object file_ (also called an .o file or a relocatable) is the result of compiling and assembling a single source file. An object file is on its way to becoming a runnable program, but it's not finished. The linker takes over from there to combine the object file with  additional object files and libraries. The linker is responsible for resolving inter-module references and relocating symbols to their final location. The output of the linker is an _executable_ file, this represents a full program that is ready to run.

#### Symbols in object files

Change to the `code/linking` directory of `lab4`. Read over the code in the files `start.s` and `cstart.c` and then build the object files `start.o` and `cstart.o`:

```console
$ make start.o cstart.o
```
The tool `nm` lists the symbols in an object file. Each function, variable, and constant declared at the top-level in the module is a _symbol_. Try `nm` out now:

```console
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n start.o cstart.o
```

What symbols are listed for `start.o`? For `cstart.o`? How do the symbols listed correspond to the functions defined in the source files?
What is the significance of the number shown in the left column for each symbol?
What do each of the single letters `T`, `U`, and `t` in the second column mean? 

Skim the man page to learn a little bit about this tool and the variety of symbol types:
```console
$ man arm-none-eabi-nm
```
Our modules will typically contain text (code) symbols and data symbols (with variants common, uninitialized, read-only). What is the significance of upper versus lowercase for the symbol type? What does the `-n` flag do?

Let's look at the symbols in a more complex object file. Review the variable definitions in the source file `linking.c`. Build `linking.o` and view its symbol list:
```console
$ make linking.o
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n linking.o
```
How many symbols are listed for `linking.o`?  What do the single letter symbols `D`, `R`, `C`, and `b` mean in the `nm` output?

Can you match each function/variable definition in `linking.c` to its symbol in the `nm` output? A few of the variables defined seem to have been completely optimized out, what made that possible? None of the parameters or stack-local variables in `linking.c` are listed as symbols, why not?

What type and size of symbol would correspond to an array definition such as  `const int[5]`? See for yourself by uncommenting the declaration on line 13 of `linking.c`, rebuild and view `arm-none-eabi-nm -S linking.o`.

#### Symbols in an executable

After compiling each individual source file into an object file, the final build step is to link the object files and libraries into a program executable. The three object files we examined above are linked together in `linking.elf`.  Use `make linking.elf` to perform the link step and then use `nm` to look at the symbols in the final executable.

```console
$ make linking.elf
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n linking.elf
```
The executable contains the union of the symbols in the three object files. What is the order of the symbols in the executable? How have the symbol addresses changed during the link process?
Do any undefined symbols remain?
What happened to the symbols previously marked `C`?

#### Resolution and relocation

The Makefile in this project has additional action that creates a `.list` file for each build step. These listing files contain the disassembly of the compiled module.  Let's look into those listings to get a better understanding of how symbols are resolved and relocated by the linker.

```console?prompt=$
$ cat start.o.list

00000000 <_start>:
       0:   mov     sp, #134217728  ; 0x8000000
       4:   mov     fp, #0
       8:   bl      0 <_cstart>

0000000c <hang>:
       c:   b       c <hang>
```

The third instruction is where `_start` calls `_cstart`. This *branch and link* instruction `bl` has 0 at the target destination address.
This target is labeled `<_cstart>`, but 0 doesn't seem quite right. In this module, 0 is the address of `_start`.  Hmm, most curious...

The listing for `linking.elf` begins with the instructions for `_start` but this is _after_ linking. What do you notice that is different now?

```console?prompt=$
$ cat linking.elf.list
 00008000 <_start>:
     8000:       mov     sp, #134217728  ; 0x8000000
     8004:       mov     fp, #0
     8008:       bl      80b8 <_cstart>

 0000800c <hang>:
     800c:       b       800c <hang>
 ...

 000080b8 <_cstart>:
     80b8:       mov     ip, sp
 ...
```

First note that after linking, the addresses (in leftmost column) start at `0x8000` and increase from there. These addresses indicate the location of each instruction in the final executable. Can you work out how each symbol's final address relate to its original offset in the object file?  The process of gathering all symbols from the modules and laying out into one combined package at their final locations is called _relocation_. The linker uses the [memmap](#memmap) to determine how and where to layout the symbols.

In the listing `start.o.list`, the destination address for the branch to `_cstart` was 0.  In the listing `linking.elf.list`, the destination address has been changed to `0x80b8`.  Read further down in the listing to see what is at address `0x80b8`. Makes sense?

In the listing for `linking.o.list` (pre-link), find the instructions for the function `main`. It contains three `bl` instructions, one is a function call to a function defined in this module (`sum`), the other two call functions outside this module (`uart_init` and `printf`).  The call within module has the function offset as destination address, but the calls to outside the module have destination address 0, used as a placeholder. In the listing `linking.elf.list` (post-link), find those same instructions for `main` and you will see all destination addresses are now filled in with the final location of the symbol.

The compiler processes only a single module (file) at a time and thus it can only resolve references to symbols that appear within the module currently being compiled. The linker runs in a subsequent pass to perform tasks that require joining across modules. The process of filling in the missing placeholder addresses with the final symbol locations is known as _resolution_.

The linker is given a list of object files to process and it will combine the files together and arrange symbols into their final locations (relocation) and resolve cross-module references (resolution).

Answer the check-in question on linking[^3].

#### Memmap

As part of the relocation process, the linker places all of the symbols into their final location. You supply a _memory map_ to the linker to indicate the layout of the sections. Let's look into this file to better understand its purpose and function.

Change to the `lab4/code/linking` directory and use `nm` to see the final locations of all the symbols in the executable.

```console
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n linking.elf
```

Note how all symbols of a given type (text, data, rodata, etc.) are grouped together into one section.

Now open the file `memmap` in your text editor. `memmap` is a _linker script_, which tells the linker how to lay out the sections in the final executable file.

- Do you see how the `memmap` linker script specifies how sections from
  individual files are to be combined?

- One of the purposes of `memmap` is to ensure that the symbol `_start`
  appears first in the executable file. Why is it critical that this 
  function be first? How does `memmap` specify where `_start`
  should be placed?

- Another purpose of `memmap` is to setup block storage of uninitialized
  variables. Look for the symbols `__bss_start__` and
  `__bss_end__`. Where are those symbols placed? In a C program, uninitialized global
  variables are to be set to 0 at program start. How does `_cstart` use the bss start/end symbols to
  zero the unset variables?

Our projects all use this same `memmap`, which defines a correct layout for a standard bare-metal C program for the Pi. You are unlikely to need to edit or customize it.  However, if you are curious to know more,
here is [documentation on linker scripts](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.21/ld/Scripts.html).

### 4. Bootloader
The _bootloader_ is the program that runs on the Raspberry Pi that waits to receive a program from your laptop and then executes it. Back in lab 1, you downloaded `bootloader.bin` from the firmware folder and copied it to your SD card under the name `kernel.img` so it is the program that runs when the Raspberry Pi resets.

So far, we have used the bootloader as a "black box". Now you are ready to open it up and learn how programs are sent from your laptop and execute on the Pi.

The bootloader we are using is a modified version of one written by 
David Welch, the person most
responsible for figuring out how to write bare metal programs on the Raspberry
Pi. If it wasn't for [his great work](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi), we would not be offering this course!

#### Xmodem file transfer protocol
Your laptop and the bootloader communicate over the serial line via the Raspberry Pi's UART. They use a simple file transfer protocol called XMODEM. In the jargon of XMODEM, your laptop initiates the transfer and acts as the _transmitter_; the bootloader acts as the _receiver_.

The transmitter divides the data from the file into chunks of 128 bytes and sends each chunk in its own _packet_.  The payload data of a packet is introduced by a three-byte header and followed by a single CRC checksum byte; each packet comprises 132 bytes in total. The transmitter and receiver synchronize after each packet to decide whether to move on to the next packet or re-try due to a transmission error.

![xmodem protocol](images/xmodem.svg){: width="50%" style="float:right;"}

To send a file, the transmitter follows these steps:

1. Wait for `NAK` from receiver.
2. Send 132-byte packet consisting of:
  - `SOH`, control character for _start of heading_ indicates start of a new packet.
  - Sequence number. First packet is numbered 1 and 
   the number increments from there; wraps to 0 after 255.
  - Complement of sequence number.
  - Payload, 128 bytes.
  - Checksum (sum all payload bytes mod 256).
3. Read response from receiver:
    - If `NAK`, re-transmit same packet.
    - If `ACK`, advance to next packet.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each packet. 
5. Send `EOT` (end of transmission), wait for `ACK`.

The receiver performs the inverse of the actions of the transmitter:

1. Send `NAK` to indicate readiness.
2. Read 132-byte packet consisting of:
    - `SOH`, sequence number, complement, payload, checksum
3. Validate packet fields (start, sequence number, complement, checksum)
     - If all valid, respond with `ACK`, advance to next packet.
     - If not, respond with `NAK` and receive same packet again.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each packet. 
5. When `EOT` received, respond with `ACK` to complete the operation.

#### Transmit: `rpi-run.py`

`rpi-run.py` is a Python script that runs on your laptop and transmits a binary program to the waiting bootloader.

It is written as python script and is compatible with any OS with proper python support. Given the handy python libraries to abstract away the details of the XMODEM protocol-handling, the script doesn't expose the internals of the send/receive mechanics. In fact, the bulk of the script is goop used to find the CP2102 driver device for different platforms. Find the script and read it over using this command in your terminal:
```console
$ cat `which rpi-run.py`
```

#### Receive: `bootloader.bin`

The `bootloader.bin` you have installed on your SD card is a C program that runs bare-metal on the Raspberry Pi. Change to the directory `lab4/code/bootloader`. This directory contains the bootloader source code. The bootloader program waits for your laptop to send it a program binary. Upon receives a program, it loads it into memory, and then branches to the code to begin execution.

First, read the assembly language file `start.s`.
Note the `.space` directive between `_start` and the label `skip`.
This has the effect of placing the bootloader code
at location `0x200000`.
This creates a hole in memory
(between 0x8000 and 0x200000).
The bootloader loads your program into that hole.
Why can't the bootloader code also be placed at 0x8000?

The `bootloader.c` file contains the C code to perform the receiver side of the XMODEM protocol. Go over the bootloader code in detail with your tablemates. Start by tracing the operation when everything goes as planned without errors, then consider what happens when things go awry.

Here are some questions to frame your discussion:

- Where does the bootloader copy the received program and how does it begin executing it? Which instruction is executed first?
- How does the bootloader use the green ACT led to signal to the user?
- In which circumstances does the bootloader respond with a `NAK`? When does the bootloader give up altogether on a transmission?
- How/why does the bootloader use the timer peripheral?
- How will the bootloader respond if you unplug the USB-serial in the middle of transmission?

With your group, annotate the bootloader source with comments documenting its operation. Divide it up, something like:
- One person documents normal operation and explains how to "read" what bootloader is doing by watching the green LED.
- Another studies checksum calculation, how errors are detected and how retry/retransmit is accomplished.
- Another reviews handling for timeout, dropped connection, and when the user cancels the operation using Control-C.
- Someone brave can read David Welch's [bootloader03.c](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/blob/master/bootloader03/bootloader03.c) and try to confirm our version is a faithful rewrite.

Have each person jot down notes and then explain their part to the group. **Collate your group's notes and annotated bootloader code and show to the CA.**[^4]

## Check in with TA
<a name="checkin"></a>
Each question below is a diagnostic question for a lab section. Test your understanding by answering the corresponding question as you finish an exercise. We encourage you to check in with a TA after
completing a section or two, while the material is still fresh in your mind.

[^1]: How does the saved `pc` in a function’s stack frame relate to the address of the first instruction for the function? If you take the saved `pc` in the stack frame for `main` and subtract it from the saved `lr` in the stack frame for `diff`, what do you get? Express your answer as a number, then explain conceptually what that computation represents. The [memory diagram for simple](images/stack_abs.html) is a helpful reference.
[^2]: How should the number of `free` calls relate to the number of `malloc` calls in a correctly-written program that uses heap allocation?
[^3]: Compare the symbol list from `nm linking.o` to `nm linking.elf`. How do the symbol addresses from an object file differ from the addresses in the linked executable?  How does the instruction `bl _cstart` change after linking?
[^4]: Show your group's marked-up copy of `bootloader.c` with your added comments.
